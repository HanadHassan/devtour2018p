# Logic Apps

### Email from Ruth:

- To get audience participation and generate Twitter buzz during the event, I think it’ll be great to do the Twitter integration demo.
- We’ll need a #HASHTAG to tell the audience to tweet to as we are doing the demo
- Here’s link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/connectors/connectors-create-api-twitter
- I used the Azure “Email yourself new tweets about a certain keyword via Outlook” Logic App template
- Demo only takes < 5 min
- Then audience will see how presenter’s email blows up in real-time when Logic App notifies them each time the #HashTag is used
